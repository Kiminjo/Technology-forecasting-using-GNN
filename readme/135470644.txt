Welcome to NERC, a project focused on outfitting a 1/10th scale RC car with the necessary sensors and software to be a functioning autonomous vehicle. We are two college students working on this project during our breaks, to learn more about the state-of-the-art algorithms and control systems implemented in industry self-driving cars and robots.
Here's a GIF of the car steering in a track autonomously!
