Vape RC (Vehicle Autonomy Platform Experiment - Robocar) is a project to build a software and hardware platform for building small scale driverless cars.
The goal behind Vape is to both build a working example and a platform to allow students/hackers to experiment with new models/approaches for AVs.
Our focus is on allowing for fast experimentation and easy extensibility of capabilities in sensors, perception, and motion planning. These capabilities are replicable due to a high fidelity simulation software and a modularized software stack.
Additionally, we are trying fast-track expertise in autonomous driving by making it easy to replicate state of the art publications.
Overall, we are trying to reconcile fast experimentation with solid engineering. Complex fields like autonomous driving require both these factors, which makes them less accessible for students and hackers.
However, small-scale efforts to appeal to these groups oftentimes neglect strong engineering at the cost of the scope and quality of what can be accomplished.
With our approach, we are trying to strike a balance and enable the implementation of more complex features/detectors into a fully functioning system.
