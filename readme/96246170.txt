Welcome to Apollo's GitHub page!
Apollo is a high performance, flexible architecture which accelerates the development, testing, and deployment of Autonomous Vehicles.
For business and partnership, please visit our website.
Apollo is loaded with new modules and features but needs to be calibrated and configured perfectly before you take it for a spin. Please review the prerequisites and installation steps in detail to ensure that you are well equipped to build and launch Apollo. You could also check out Apollo's architecture overview for a greater understanding of Apollo's core technology and platforms.
[New 2021-01] The Apollo platform (stable version) is now upgraded with software packages and library dependencies of newer versions including:
We do not expect a disruption to your current work, but to ease your life of migratation, you would need to:
The vehicle equipped with the by-wire system, including but not limited to brake-by-wire, steering-by-wire, throttle-by-wire and shift-by-wire (Apollo is currently tested on Lincoln MKZ)
A machine with a 8-core processor and 16GB memory minimum
NVIDIA Turing GPU is strongly recommended
Ubuntu 18.04
NVIDIA driver version 455.32.00 and above (Web link)
Docker-CE version 19.03 and above (Official doc)
NVIDIA Container Toolkit (Official doc)
Please note, it is recommended that you install the versions of Apollo in the following order: 1.0 -> whichever version you would like to test out. The reason behind this recommendation is that you need to confirm whether individual hardware components and modules are functioning correctly, and clear various version test cases before progressing to a higher and more capable version for your safety and the safety of those around you.
The following diagram highlights the scope and features of each Apollo release:

Apollo 1.0:
Apollo 1.0, also referred to as the Automatic GPS Waypoint Following, works in an enclosed venue such as a test track or parking lot. This installation is necessary to ensure that Apollo works perfectly with your vehicle. The diagram below lists the various modules in Apollo 1.0.

Apollo 1.5:
Apollo 1.5 is meant for fixed lane cruising. With the addition of LiDAR, vehicles with this version now have better perception of its surroundings and can better map its current position and plan its trajectory for safer maneuvering on its lane. Please note, the modules highlighted in Yellow are additions or upgrades for version 1.5.

Apollo 2.0:
Apollo 2.0 supports vehicles autonomously driving on simple urban roads. Vehicles are able to cruise on roads safely, avoid collisions with obstacles, stop at traffic lights, and change lanes if needed to reach their destination. Please note, the modules highlighted in Red are additions or upgrades for version 2.0.

Apollo 2.5:
Apollo 2.5 allows the vehicle to autonomously run on geo-fenced highways with a camera for obstacle detection. Vehicles are able to maintain lane control, cruise and avoid collisions with vehicles ahead of them.

Apollo 3.0:
Apollo 3.0's primary focus is to provide a platform for developers to build upon in a closed venue low-speed environment. Vehicles are able to maintain lane control, cruise and avoid collisions with vehicles ahead of them.

Apollo 3.5:
Apollo 3.5 is capable of navigating through complex driving scenarios such as residential and downtown areas. The car now has 360-degree visibility, along with upgraded perception algorithms to handle the changing conditions of urban roads, making the car more secure and aware. Scenario-based planning can navigate through complex scenarios, including unprotected turns and narrow streets often found in residential areas and roads with stop signs.

Apollo 5.0:
Apollo 5.0 is an effort to support volume production for Geo-Fenced Autonomous Driving. The car now has 360-degree visibility, along with upgraded perception deep learning model to handle the changing conditions of complex road scenarios, making the car more secure and aware. Scenario-based planning has been enhanced to support additional scenarios like pull over and crossing bare intersections.

Apollo 5.5:
Apollo 5.5 enhances the complex urban road autonomous driving capabilities of previous Apollo releases, by introducing curb-to-curb driving support. With this new addition, Apollo is now a leap closer to fully autonomous urban road driving. The car has complete 360-degree visibility, along with upgraded perception deep learning model and a brand new prediction model to handle the changing conditions of complex road and junction scenarios, making the car more secure and aware.

Apollo 6.0:
Apollo 6.0 incorporates new deep learning models to enhance the capabilities for certain Apollo modules. This version works seamlessly with new additions of data pipeline services to better serve Apollo developers. Apollo 6.0 is also the first version to integrate certain features as a demonstration of our continuous exploration and experimentation efforts towards driverless technology.
