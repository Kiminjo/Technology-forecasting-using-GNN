The documents contained in this repository provide all of the information required to construct and operate a complete DiRa platform. The platform has two primary parts, the chassis and compute box. The platform has two version:
Look though the documentation and Download Pack1 or Download Pack2 for our latest release. Look over the Getting Started section in the chassis and compute box instruction documents, followed by the parts list and the operating procedures to get a sense of the build process, skill requirements, fabrication methods, and testing procedures. The AutoRally platform can be fabricated by a small team (2-3 students) of non-professionals. The build will go most smoothly if there is at least one person on the team familiar with basic soldering, 3D printing, Ubuntu and ROS configuration. We also link to tutorials for all of the skills required, so any interested party can easily acquire them.
