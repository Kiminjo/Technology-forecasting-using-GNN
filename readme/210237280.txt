The goal of this project is to attack end-to-end self-driving models using physically realizable adversaries.
Note: We highly recommend you use the dockerized version of our repository, due to being system independent. Furthermore, it would not affect the packages on your system.
This starts Carla as a server on port 2000. Give it about 10-30 seconds to start up depending on your system.
Note: This requires port 8000 to be free.
Note: the Jupyter notebook version of this script, called start_infraction_experiments.ipynb describes each step in detail. It is recommended to use that while starting out with this repository. Use jupyter notebook to start a jupyter server in this directory.
It is expected that you have some experience with dockers, and have installed and tested your installation to ensure you have GPU access via docker containers. A quick way to test it is by running:
And you should get a standard nvidia-smi output.
