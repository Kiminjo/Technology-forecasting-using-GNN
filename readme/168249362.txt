H2O.ai created AI Tutorials out of inspiration for democratizing open source, distributed machine learning. Our tutorials are open to anyone in the community who would like to learn Distributed Machine Learning through step-by-step tutorials. Tutorials housed here are targeted at people of all skill levels.
Tutorials are developed and maintained on Github and published onto the H2O.ai Learning Center under Self-Paced Tutorials.
Begin your journey by browsing the tutorials in the H2O.ai Learning Center under Self-Paced Tutorials.
If you run into problems that prevent you from completing a tutorial, head on over to the H2O.ai Community (Hac) and chat with Data Scientists all over the world.
If you are certain there is an issue with the tutorial, please create a new issue on Github, and we will do our best to resolve it.
Fix issues, help clarify topics, update a tutorial to be compatible with the newest releases, or even create a brand new tutorial!
If you'd rather suggest changes or fixes to make, or if you have an idea for a new tutorial you'd like to see, feel free to create a new issue, and a community member will check it out.
