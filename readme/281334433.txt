MOBATSim (Model-based Autonomous Traffic Simulation Framework) is a simulation framework based on MATLAB Simulink that allows the user to assess vehicle level and traffic level safety by a 3D traffic simulation.

MOBATSim has a project file which includes the Simulink files and their paths. As you run MOBATSim.prj, a GUI will open and you can run simulations from that GUI. The live script is a more detailed documentation than this one.
