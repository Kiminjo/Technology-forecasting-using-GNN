A communications suite for self-driving vehicles
The goal of this project is to build a protocol that will allow two smart cars of any maker to communicate in order to work around/with eachother. If the communication channel cannot be defined then the car will simply reside to it's manufactuer's instructions on how to deal with the object it is detecting.
