This repository allows to run an autonomous mobility-on-demand scenario using the amodeus library.
Try it, orchestrate your own fleet of amod-taxis! Watch a visualization of a traffic simulation in San Francisco generated using this repository.




AMoDeus is jointly maintained and further developed by the Admins and Code Owners Christian Fluri (ETH Zürich), Joel Gächter (ETH Zürich), Sebastian Hörl (ETH Zürich), Claudio Ruch, Jan Hakenberg, ChengQi Lu (TU Berlin), and Marc Albert (nuTonomy).
