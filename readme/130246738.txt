This is the first Project due for the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree, after the Computer Vision Fundamentals Module.
For it, the goal is to identify the Left and Right lanes, in a set of images first and a video feed later, taken from a camera mounted in a fixed position in front of a moving car. The lanes are then shown on the original image/video stream, as continuous lines.
Specifically, three steps can be identified:
To complete the project, two files are submitted and part of this Git repo: a file containing project code in the form of a Jupyther Python notebook and an annotated writeup describing the fundamental aspects and limitations of the solution implemented.
