animal_detector: Signal processing library to detect the pulse emitted from the VHF radio tags.
common: A common library used for pulse_server and telemetry_host
io_proxy: The input/output proxy tool for multiplexing Mavlink messages between different I/O connection
pulse_server: A full signal processing module installed on Intel Edison board, which communicates with a SDR to detect and analyze transmitted pulses from radio tags.
services: contains a service file for pulse_server that to run automatically on the Intel Edison board when it restarts.
telemetry_host: An interface program which provides REST api to communicate betweentracking and planning algorithm written in MATLAB and the UAV.
