The Mule: the forbidden love-child issuing from a male donkey (a jack) and a mare. Sure footed. Even tempered. Ok, maybe your friends laugh at you from their fancy horses, their thoroughbreds, their imported Arabians; but we'll see who gets the last laugh!
muleAI is inspired by the DonkeyCar project. We decided not to fork, but to rewrite.
muleAI is a systematic re-implementation of some core functionality with some priorities in mind:
muleAI is a lightweight python library that facilitates research and development in autonomous mobility at RC-scale.
muleAI is a foundation for further experiments in mobility, autonomous hardware, embedded AI, Internet Of Things, ...
UPDATE? Tensor flow 1.8 (includes keras as tf.keras)
Simplicity and consistency in modular design
Clean, well-structured implementation conforming to standard software design principles
As much as possible is exposed to configuration, allowing rapid changing of parameters during racing days
Allows for fast timestep analysis, strict ordering and alignment of states
Enforce proper interface for all new parts
Include default behaviors such as class strings
D-pad left/right on the PS3 controller iterates over adjustment settings
D-pad up/down on the PS3 controller adjusts that value by SHIFT amount
Currently able to adjust max forward/reverse throttle and steering
Release candidate 1.0
