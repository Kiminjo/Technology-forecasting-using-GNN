Code Quality
We will use Conda for managing environments. We recommend installing Miniconda for Python 3.8 here. Then create an environment with
activate it with
and install all dependencies with
Then clone the repo in a directory of your choice
and install it
Also, our training data is stored here  so download it and unzip it in the same folder as perception.
Misc code, camera calibration etc.
Code for specific tasks like
etc
In order to create your own algorithm to test:
Create <your_algo>.py and put it in one of the specific task folders in perception/tasks.
Create a class which extends the TaskPerceiver class. perception/tasks/TaskPerceiver.py includes a template with documentation for how to do this.
Visualization tools Code for testing tasks (Ideally this should be placed a separate folder called tests).
After writing the code for your specific task algorithm, you can do one of two things:
Add this to the end of .py file:
and then run
Add this to the perception/init.py file:
and then run
The algorithm parameter is required. If data isn't specified, it'll default to your webcam. If profile isn't specified, it will be off by default. Add the save_video tag if you want to save your vis test as an mp4 file.
