Source code for the autonomy algorithm for Team Navikai Robosub. The top-level code will be contained within main.py, the only interface between operator and the AUV. All other files will be called upon by main.
We are using the Jetson Xavier, two Raspberry Pi 4's, and Pixhawk as processor boards that will run the autonomy software.
