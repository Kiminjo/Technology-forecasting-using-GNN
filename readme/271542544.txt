improving the dev workflow friction is paramount to innovating openpilot
PRs accepted! What cool shit do you do to your ssh session with your car??

To install these utilities, SSH into your comma device running neos (ie Comma 2, Eon, etc), and paste in the following:
Read the README for -ryan/powerline-shell. You will need to install the fonts on the computer/terminal emulator that you SSH from
Alternately, you can install Nerd Fonts, as it provides more icons than powerline fonts, and is more maintained.
Once NEOS 15 comes out, zsh will be used and powerlevel10k will be the optimal powerline
The default directory of your bash/ssh session is now /data/openpilot. Much easier to git pull after shelling in.

Emu my neo! You should now be able to use the emu command.
Once you've installed, you can update via the utility
This will essentially perform a git pull and replace all current files in the /data/community/.oh-my-comma directory with new ones, if an update is available, as well as check the integrity of the files that must remain elsewhere on the filesystem such as the .bashrc and powerline configs
To see more information about each command and its arguments, checkout the full command documentation here.
When you first run any emu fork command, emu will ask you to perform a one-time setup of cloning the base repository of openpilot from commaai. This may take a while, but upon finishing the setup you will be able to switch to any openpilot fork much quicker than the time it usually takes to full-clone a new fork the old fashioned way.
For each new fork you install with the emu fork switch command, Git is able to re-use blobs already downloaded from commaai/openpilot and other similar installed forks, enabling quicker install times.
In a rw filesystem, you can edit your git config so you can push your changes up easily.
if the git pull fails, just do some action on git that requires authentication, and you should be good to go
