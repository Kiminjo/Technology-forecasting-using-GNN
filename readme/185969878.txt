FYP Spring 2019: Self Driving Car
Objective
The aim of this project is to develop an autonomous car on a small-scale model, which drives safely and intelligently reaching to its destination. The idea behind this project is to research and work with different algorithms falling under Machine learning, Deep learning and Computer vision. Machine learning relies heavily on data and is a crucial aspect for training. Therefore, dataset is also generated, which is challenging on its own since the data will be raw and will require data cleaning. A camera module will be providing real world data, whereas an ultra-sonic sensor will aid in detecting obstacles. Furthermore, comparisons between algorithms and analysis will be driven. The Remote Car will be able to: • Perform Lane detection (Identify, follow and stay within the lanes) • Control speed • Obstacle detection (Drive around the track with obstacles. Identifying, avoiding, stopping and taking necessary actions)
