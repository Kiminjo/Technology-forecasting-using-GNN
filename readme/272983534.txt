OATomobile is a library for autonomous driving research. OATomobile strives to expose simple, efficient, well-tuned and readable agents, that serve both as reference implementations of popular algorithms and as strong baselines, while still providing enough flexibility to do novel research.
If you just want to get started using OATomobile quickly, the first thing to know about the framework is that we wrap CARLA towns and scenarios in OpenAI gyms:
Baselines can also be used out-of-the-box:
We have tested OATomobile on Python 3.5.
To install the core libraries (including CARLA, the backend simulator):
