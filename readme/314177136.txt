To build a motion prediction model to reliably predict the motion/movement of traffic agents (e.g. cars, cyclists and pedestrians) which are within an Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) environment. In short, to predict the trajectories of traficc participants (AKA agents)
"The division of the ride-hailing company that is responsible for its research and development of self-driving vehicle technology (hence the name, which is borrowed from SAEâ€™s levels of autonomy for cars, with Level 5 being the highest)."
SAE's: Society of Automotive Engineer's
Recall Competition Goal: Predict the trajectories of other traffic participants.
Note: "Due to the high amount of multi-modality and ambiguity in traffic scenes, the used evaluation metric to score this competition is tailored to account for multiple predictions." Lyft Motion Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles.

Evaluation & Scoring
We are encouraged to employ/make submissions of multi-modal predictions as traffic scenes can contain a large amount of ambiguity & uncertainty. Furthermore, we are "asked to submit predictions for a private test set (no ground truth is available)" and our "solutions will be scored by Kaggle." [^1].
The scoring is done by calculating the negative log-likelihood of the ground truth data given the multi-modal predictions.

Uni-modal models: Yields 1 prediction per input sample
Multi-modal: Yields multiple hypotheses (up to 3) - further described by a confidence vector.
