The aim of the project is to assemble an Raspberry Pi controlled robot car. The scope includes the assembly of motors and required parts from the hardware perspective. It also includes programming so that the car can be sent signals wirelessly to a PC-based front-end to initiate actions such as ignition, movement, steering etc. Finally, from the software end, it requires a front-end through which the car will be controlled. This front-end will provide both a GUI-based interface (which will show the images being captured by the car through its camera) as well as other statistics of the movement. It will also provide library bindings to programmatically control the car through another software.
Its contains the code that run inside the car and provide controls to remote pc via WS Server.
Its contains the code related to Python library which controls the car through remote pc.
Its contains the Graphical interface of the interfaces provided in pyDrivingMatter.
Its contains the code which are obsolete.
