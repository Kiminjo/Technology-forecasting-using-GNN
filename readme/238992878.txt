Instructions
Train a model by running model.py. By default the code saves it as "model.h5".
To change what training data your model trains on you must manually change to the correct .csv and image folder in main, the default is to train a model on data from both tracks.
We construct visualizations of layer activations from a random training-image after training a model that are saved in docs/plots.
Run models by executing "python3 drive.py " in terminal. Some good models are provided for you already.
