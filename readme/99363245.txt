Linorobot is a suite of Open Source ROS compatible robots that aims to provide students, developers, and researchers a low-cost platform in creating new exciting applications on top of ROS.
We're a group of students adapting and building one, documenting our build process following the tutorial at www.linorobot.org
We also wrote original follower algorithms for the LiDAR!
