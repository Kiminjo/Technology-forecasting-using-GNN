Track design is modular in a way that parts can be used in a few different configurations.
Cornered parts are available in both 8m and 12m long variants.

Track is meant to be printed on 2m wide parts on black. Yellow should stay as is but red is supposed to be printed as white.
Our material has been PVC and Polyester tarpaulin.
