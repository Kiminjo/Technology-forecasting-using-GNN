This autonomous vehicle project's goal is to create autonomous racing vehicles in the simplest possible wayâ€”a good first car. The name is a mash-up of Fubar Labs, the mysterious planes called "foo fighters" and "foobar" the ubiquitous getting started variables for programming. The control system can scale to any vehicles using RC controls.
Autonmous Vehicle Project at Fubar Labs for the Autonomous Powerwheels Racing compeition.
Code is installed from the Raspberry PI using PLatform IO
Obtain the car code by cloning the project
Install system packages
Install poetry
Install platformio
Use poetry to create the generate the car
Use poetry to create the car code and service
Test the PI Hat
Test the Car Runner
Verify the leds and switches are working.
Set up the raspberry pi services
Verify the car serice is running the car runner
Find a system with a good gpu. It was slow but worked on a Raspberry PI 4.
