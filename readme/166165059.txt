The remediation feature of Cloud Workload Assurance provides details of failed checks in the remediation input payload to fix the misconfigurations that are observed on AWS resources. You can either use the lambda scripts provided by CWA, or use an alternate method to fix the failed checks. After the issues are fixed, remediation output payload is generated and an update can be sent to CWA. You can scan your resources to verify the fixes. You can monitor the remediation process by referring to the CloudWatch logs of lambda.
You can configure remediation using the CFT provided by CWA or complete the steps manually.
For detailed information about the remediation feature, refer to the following link: -remediation-in-Cloud-Workload-Assurance?locale=EN_US
