Utilities for autonomous driving. Based on donkeycar autonomous RC-car project
Recording the training includes saving screencaps and corresponding controller values (throttle and steering axes).
Training takes your test data in and saves a model file to use for driving.
Letting the AI behind the wheel means that a script starts taking screencaps and feeding them into the trained neural network model. Neural network then returns throttle and steering value, which in turn are pushed through a virtual joystick.
