This is a Terraform module that deploys H2O.ai Driverless AI on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). It is developed jointly by Oracle and H2O.ai.
First off you'll need an OCI tenancy. If you don't have one, you can sign up here.
DAI requires a license key. If you don't already have a key, you can get a trial key. You can deploy these templates before you get a key, but you'll be prompted for a key at first login.
To deploy, simply click the magic button!

That will direct you over to ORM. Once there, walk through the wizard. When that's complete, run an apply.
The apply prints the URL of H2O Driverless AI when it completes. The deployment creates a self-signed certificate, so you'll need to confirm the exception.
Logging into that we see:

After accepting the agreement, we can see the login screen. Use the login defined in the variables.tf file:

The documentation here provides a walkthrough and some good next steps. There are a bunch of public data sets to get you started. Here's an example of an experiment I set up on one using that walkthrough.

This machine is using Oracle Linux (OL). The default login is opc. You can SSH into the machine with a command like this:

H2O is installed under /opt/h2o. Logs from the install are under /var/log/messages and viewable with root privileges.
You can also login to the web console here to view the IaaS that is running DAI.

When you no longer need the deployment, you can login to ORM and destroy the deployment. When that's complete, you can destroy the stack.
Marketplace - There's a listing here that deploys the same code that is in this Quick Start. It's kept in sync using our CI/CD.
Resource Manager - OCI Resource Manager (ORM) is Oracle's Terraform as a service. Instructions on deploying with it follow.
