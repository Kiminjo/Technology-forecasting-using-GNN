The goal of the competition was to create an autonomous car, which can navigate in a labyrinth, change lanes, follow a safety car and then compete in a speed race. The detailed rule book is in the project root directory as "rules_hun.pdf".

The brain of the car was a STM32F446RE developer board.
The autonomous car's base is a HPI MAVERICK STRADA XT.
The code is written in C language. The project is based on FreeRTOS and consists of several tasks.
Tasks:
96 TCRT5000 reflective sensors for line following
BOSCH BNO055 absolute orientation sensor
Sharp GP2Y0A02YK0F analog distance sensor
Multichannel ADC reading with DMA
Line following with state space controller
Motor speed with PID controller
Labyrinth solving algorithm (Dijkstra's algorithm, Graph-based)
