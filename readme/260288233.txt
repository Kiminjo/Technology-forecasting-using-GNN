LIME is an open source 3D LiDAR-based localisation framework. This framework enables localisation in a premapped environment. Prior mapping can be achieved by using packages like loam_velodyne and LeGO_LOAM. Wheel odometry is used to provide high frequency, low accuracy updates which are corrected by low frequency, high accuracy ICP corrections.
