UberPoC is an autonomous software able to detect lines on the ground, detect signs, traffic lights and pedestrians.
If you want to try Line Detection System through a video or the Duckietown Simulator :
You can press L to toggle line detection
You can also use N to see different step of normalization
If you want to try Sign Detection over an image or your Camera:
To try Human Detection over an image:
pyglet
imutils
numpy
matplotlib
opencv-contrib-python
tensorflow
scikit-learn
keras
beautifulsoup4
Line Detection : Displays the lines on the ground while the car is driving.
Pedestrian Detection: Circle the pedestrians and cyclists on an image.
Detection and recognition of road signs : Circle and name traffic signs
Auto pilot : Combine all the features in order to have an autonomous car
More road signs and traffic lights : Find dataset of others signs and traffic lights to train AI
We cut the top of the image in order to gain precision by having only the bottom with the lines
Then we apply a red filter on the image to better differentiate the white lines from the rest of the image
Using the Canny function of OpenCV, the lines are cut
Using the HoughLinesP function we get an array with the different points that make up the lines
With these arrays the lines are estimated and displayed on the screen
To detect the pedestrians on a road we use a function of OpenCV (HOGDescriptor_getDefaultPeopleDetector()) who get all the regions of each person on an image
Then we iterate on these regions and display a rectangle around each pedestrian
To detect the different traffic signs present on an image or video, we use an AI based on a particular model the "Faster R-CNN" (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks)
AI will scan the full image of small regions to be able to detect a sign on the image
Once the sign is found it will identify it and then surround it on the image with its accuracy rate and type
