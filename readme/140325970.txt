NoisePage is a relational database management system developed by the Carnegie Mellon Database Group. The research goal of the NoisePage project is to develop high-performance system components that support autonomous operation and optimization as a first-class design principle.
The NoisePage project is built and tested on Ubuntu 20.04. No other environments are officially supported.
You can now connect to NoisePage over the Postgres client psql.
