What we have done in this project:
We have used Single Shot Detector Inception v2 model that was pretrained with COCO dataset. And we have further trained it with the help of TF Object Detection API with udacity's simulator and real images given in the bag file. Detailed results are in: tl_detection.ipynb
Car is able to perform all the requirements that were asked. Here is a vid from simulator:

This is the project repo for the final project of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car. For more information about the project, see the project introduction here.
