Welcome to PGDrive! PGDrive is an driving simulator with many key features, including:

Please install PGDrive via:
If you wish to contribute to this project or make some modification, you can clone the latest version of PGDrive locally and install via:
You can verify the installation and efficiency of PGDrive via running:
The above script is supposed to be runnable in all places. Note that please do not run the above command in the folder that has a sub-folder called ./pgdrive.
Please run the following line to drive the car in the environment manually with keyboard!
You can also enjoy a journey carrying out by our professional driver pretrained from reinforcement learning!
A fusion of expert and manual controller, where the expect will try to rescue the manually controlled vehicle from danger, can be experienced via:
To show the main feature, procedural generation, we provide a script to show BIG:
Note that the above three scripts can not be run in headless machine. Please refer to the installation guideline in documentation for more information.
Running the following line allows you to draw the generated maps:
To build the environment in python script, you can simply run:
We also prepare a Colab which demonstrates some basic usage of PGDrive as follows:
We also define several Gym environment names, so user can start training in the minimalist manner:
The following table presents some predefined environment names.
More information about PGDrive can be found in PGDrive Documentation. Besides, the training code of our paper can be found in this repo.
