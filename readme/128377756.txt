open ~/.bashrc and add export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig in the last line
R == 255: this is occupied R != 255: this is free region B == 255: this is the target point G == 255: estimated path points (monitor_map only)
(R,G,B) ==(200,200,200): this is lidar position
PathArray: for path data, delta: the delta that the hybrid A* used for the current fragment of the path, this can be used for estimation of curvature of the path
let's use curvature Cost for estimation of path curvature
