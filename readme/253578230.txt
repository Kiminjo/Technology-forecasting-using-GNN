The Aqualink ASV is an open-source reference design for an autonomous surface vehicle. Included in this project are all hardware & electronics designs, software components, and instructions necessary to outfit a generic boat hull to navigate autonomously and collect camera and sensor data.
This project is designed around a collection of existing software projects, such as ROS2, Ardupilot, QGroundControl, and more. All hardware components are off-the-shelf with links to suppliers within the included Bill of Materials document. The construction process has been tailored to require no soldering and minimal, standard tools.
The project is split into three main folders, each with their own setup guides:
While there is a great deal of flexibility in which order to read and follow the instructions, the order we recommend is:
Here is an image that shows the way all of the nodes connect together via ROS2 topics:

For more information on each software node, see:
groundstation/: Contains setup instructions and software that will be run on a Linux laptop used to control the vehicle.
hardware/: Contains all drawings & CAD (electrical and mechanical), assembly instructions and photos, and the bill of materials.
vehicle/: Contains setup instructions and software for both the Nvidia Jetson Nano and Rambutan OpenWRT router that are installed in the vehicle electronics box.
