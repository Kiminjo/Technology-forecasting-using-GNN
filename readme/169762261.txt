2019-2020:
Advice for next year's team 
Changed to Arduino Nano for simplicity of use. Using HC-12 as antenna (need to check if actually compliant with competition guidelines, 2019 team said something about not being FCC compliant), and a UBLOX NEO-M8N for GPS signal. We are using the Arduino TinyGPS++ and the pre-installed SoftwareSerial libraries.
HC-12 antenna settings:
2018-19: Autonomous drive software for UGV, written for OpenPilot Revolution using the airbourne_f4 library for hardware abstraction.
to change settings connect ground to "set" pin on antenna
Arduino monitor must be on same baud rate as communication
send "AT" to HC-12 and antenna will return with "OK"
"AT+RX" will return all of the current settings
"AT+Bxxxxx" will set baud rate
"AT+FUx" will set power/range settings
"AT+Cxxxx" will set channel Current Settings:
FU4 (high power and long distance, max of 1200 baud rate. The default is FU3, )
baud rate: 1200 (default is 9600)
