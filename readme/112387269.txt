Steps to update github from the terminal:

Add new or modified files to git:
git add [directory_name] # to add all files from a directory
or
Remove a file from git:
git rm [directory_name] -r # to recursively remove all files from a directory
or
Apply your changes
git commit
Upload the changes to github:
git push

git pull
root
