Semantic Segmentation of point clouds using range images.
Developed by Andres Milioto, Jens Behley, Ignacio Vizzo, and Cyrill Stachniss
Examples of segmentation results from SemanticKITTI dataset:
This code provides code to train and deploy Semantic Segmentation of LiDAR scans, using range images as intermediate representation. The training pipeline can be found in /train. We will open-source the deployment pipeline soon.
To enable kNN post-processing, just change the boolean value to True in the arch_cfg.yaml file parameter, inside the model directory.
These are the predictions for the train, validation, and test sets. The performance can be evaluated for the training and validation set, but for test set evaluation a submission to the benchmark needs to be made (labels are not public).
No post-processing:
With k-NN processing:
