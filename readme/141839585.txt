Consistency with the markdown effects the layout of the side panel as well as the over all consistency between sections. Here are some recommended guidelines:
 
To center an image, wrap in a div with the class img_container like in the example above. Four separate sizes were created using css:
thumbnail { width: 50px }
sm_img { width: 200px }
lg_img { width: 400px }
wide_img { width: 90% }
Add custom image sizes in extra.css
 
Add a line between sections : <p>&nbsp;</p>
There should always be an empty line before bulleted lists
For instructions, add lines between list items
Capitalize all header titles
