BARK-ML provides simple-to-use OpenAi-Gym environments for several scenarios, such as highway driving, merging and intersections. Additionally, BARK-ML integrates state-of-the-art machine learning libraries to learn driving behaviors for autonomous vehicles.
BARK-ML supported machine learning libraries:
Before running the examples, install the virtual python environment (bash utils/install.sh) and enter it (source utils/dev_into.sh).
Continuous environments: bazel run //examples:continuous_env

Available environments:
TF-Agents SAC-example: bazel run //examples:tfa:

The experiment runner provides a convenient way of running configurations in a reproducible way. For a more elaborate documentation have look here.
