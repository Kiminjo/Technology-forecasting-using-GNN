This is a Formula Student Driverless Simulator (FSDS). FSDS is a community project with the goal to provide an end-to-end simulation for FS Driverless teams. It simulates all commonly used sensors and is compatible with ROS. This project has proven itsself during FS-Online 2020 where 4 driverless teams competed. See day 1, day 2 and day 3.

FSDS has been originally developed by your friends at Formula Student Team Delft, MIT Driverless and FSEast.
/UE4Project is the Unreal Engine 4 project. In here you will find everything that runs inside Unreal Engine. This includes the world, all assets and the AirSim server. The AirSim server uses the AirLib shared code (see /AirSim/AirLib).
/ros is a ROS workspace that contains the fsds_ros_bridge. This node can connect 1 autonomous system with the simulated world.
/python is a python client to connect with the simulator.
/AirSim is a slimmed-down, hard-fork of the AirSim project. There is only C++ code located that is shared between ros-bridge and Unreal Engine. When AirSim is compiled, the AirLib binaries are placed within /UE4Project/Plugins/AirSim/Source/AirLib.
/operator is a python project that offers a web GUI for officials to control the simulation, stores lap times and chooses what car is currently connected to the world. It launches the fsds_ros_bridge to connect an autonomous system to the Unreal world and stops the bridge when the autonomous system is no longer allowed to control the car.
This repo uses LFS for some large files. All files bigger than 90MB are added to LFS.
This project is based on the work of some amazing open-source projects.
Primarily, the AirSim project built by Microsoft and many open-source contributors. Without it, we could have never done this.
Many game assets like the surrounding world are based on assets from the Formula Student Technion Driverless AirSim fork. These assets made this project look as cool as it does now.
