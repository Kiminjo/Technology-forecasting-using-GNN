If you want to build the different submodules without Docker, check the Dockerfiles for the required dependencies!
Clone this branch onto the Computer you want to deploy (should be Leia). First, if not already happened, create the docker folder (mkdir docker). Then, clone the .Dockerfiles from this repo using the command
Build the containers like so:
In general, add --network=host to enable network connection via the host PC.
For building the sensors Docker add -d --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 to the docker run
Currently, data is stored in a volume on the host PC called ad-data. To mount it to the docker container, add --mount source=ad-data,target=/path/where/you/want/the/data:
To start the container:
To enter a docker bash:
To exit the docker, in the docker shell type exit
To stop the container:
sudo docker kill docker_name forces shutdown of docker docker_name
sudo docker ps (shows active dockers)
sudo docker ps -a (shows all dockers)
