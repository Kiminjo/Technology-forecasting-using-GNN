Main repository to setup the Maila project. The Maila project wants to build an autonomous car model on top of a traxxas summit rc car
Docker. To intall Docker follow the procedure reported here

Install Visual Studio Code
There is a handy installation script that clones the repository list contained in .maila.repos, install the necessary Visual Studio Code extension and load the environment. If an src folder already exist in the repository the clone step is skipped.
The remove_envoronment.sh script contains function to ease the process of running the docker image realized to support the development of the Maila software. There are 2 ways to interact with the system
using visual studio code: here visual studio code will run the docker image and eventually we can use external terminal to connect to this images. For this just open vs-code in the workspace directory and let the ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers code extension to build and start the container for you.
manual: we can start the container manually. At first source remote_environment.sh this will load a set of bash function that will speed up the process and then:
When you have a running instance of the development docker when source emote_environment.sh the script will automatically attach to the running container. Alternatively if the source were done before running the container you could also use the function d_attach to attach to a running container
When attaching to the docker console a set of aliases are loaded to ease the development
To load the project aliases, the ros packages and environment variables run:
If you want to automatically source the maila environment add the step on~/.bashrc .
