This is a new project from Shanghai, China, which is originally based on DonkeyCar. We have built an Arduino chassis with high performance, modified several configurations and chosen tensorflow version at 1.8.0 and donkeycar version at 2.5.1 of master branch.
P.S. Simulators just work well on Linux and MAC now, Windows version need fixing.
