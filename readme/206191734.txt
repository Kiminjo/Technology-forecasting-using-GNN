This repository is devoted to share the autonomous code of Beijing Institute of Technology Driverless Racing Team. Some simple version code of an autonomous FS race car and some helpful tools are included.
The use of Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS Melodic is assumed everywhere on this repository.
The repository consists of ros and tools, ros is organised in several top level packages/directories. The top level should adhere to the following subdivision of functionality(a more detailed description can be found in the folders themselves):
perception/ - folder for perception packages
estimation/ - folder for estimation packages
planning/ - folder for planning packages
control/ - folder for control packagess
interface_fssim/ - folder for communicating with simulator
Our goal is to provide a simple implementation of the competition. For ease of use, most ros node use the ros standard message type to send/recieve.
We will continue to open source our autonomous code, when this part is stable and simple enough.
