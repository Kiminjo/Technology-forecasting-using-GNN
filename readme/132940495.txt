FusionAD is an autonomous driving software stack developed by the SJSU Autonomous Driving Team at San Jose State University (SJSU), San Jose, CA.
Our challenge is to create a fully functional autonomous driving vehicle within the 1 Year timeline of a Mechanical Engineering Senior Project at SJSU.


This repository mainly capture the software application layer within FusionAD's architecture.
Currently, all the modules are under work in progress and they are located under FusionAD/src/modules
Current capabilities of the software modules:
One of the goals at SJSU Autonomous Driving is to make autonomy development more accessible and cheaper.
Therefore, our sensor stack consisted of mainly low-cost and easily attainable sensors.
Current computation architecture mimics a distributed system for distributing tasks and loads between the two resource-heavy modules, perception and map-based localization.

FusionAD also appreciate the help of other passionate SJSU students!
We would like to acknowledge the following FusionADers:
Perception
Integration done with Yolo V3 image detector
Localization
EKF through robot_localization package
Dead reckoning vehicle kinematic model
Initial Calibration routine
Transforms between sensors and tracking frames

Low-level actuator controller
Tele-op interface
CAN Bus interface
Simulation
OSV Sim
A full fledge vehicle simulator on the Gazebo Simulation Platform
Control SIL
A Real-time, Software In the Loop testing environment for high-level controller vaidation.
