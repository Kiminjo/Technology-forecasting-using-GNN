This repository is part of Real-Time Innovations' Case + Code project, a project to create code for real-world RTI Connext DDS use cases.
This use case shows how Connext DDS can be used by Autonomous Vehicle developers to leverage RTIâ€™s extensive experience with autonomous robotics, safety-critical systems and state-of-the-art architectures to simplify development, design and integration.
This use case example should be a stepping stone for creating real distributed applications based on RTI Connext DDS. Additional information about this use case can be found on RTI's Case + Code page.
RTI Connext DDS software includes the world's leading implementation of the Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS). DDS is the only open standard for messaging that supports the unique needs of both enterprise and real-time systems. Its open interfaces and advanced integration capabilities slash costs across a system's lifecycle, from initial development and integration through on-going maintenance and upgrades.
