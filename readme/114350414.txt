Compete agains other teams in this AI-controlled car race.
You'll be divided up in teams with 3-4 people per team. Each team will be given a Robocar to name and race with.
It helps to be familiar with at least some of the technologies listed below:
You'll need to do the following before starting the lab:
The lab instructions are divided up in 3 tracks, which the team can run in parallell.
In the Drive track, you'll prepare the car for racing. You'll need to work with the Raspberry Pi that runs the car, calibrate the PWM motor controller for steering and throttle, and finally drive the car using a remote control. It's your job to generate good data for the deep learning algorithm to train on. You'll also run the car autonomously using the trained model.
In the ML track, you'll dig into the training of the car. You'll look at the data produced by the car when driving manually (the Drive track), get familiar with the Donkey python library and the tools it provides for working with the data, then train and evaluate your first model using a sample data set in AWS SageMaker. Finally, you'll dig deeper into the neural network to see if it can be improved in some way.
In the IoT track, you'll look at the collecting and reporting of metrics to the cloud. You'll provision the car for authenticating with AWS IoT service using JITR, then start coding your own Donkey python library part to report data you think is important to the cloud. You'll also work with the data pipeline already present in the AWS account to visualize your data using tools like Grafana.
