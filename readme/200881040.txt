The theme of this project is autonomous driving using FPGA. The car mainly uses CCD/CMOS cameras for environment recognition and uses the information obtained from the cameras to run image processing algorithms in the FPGA. The car body uses parts from LEGO MindStorms ev3. This project will work towards FPT2019 FPGA Design Competition.
