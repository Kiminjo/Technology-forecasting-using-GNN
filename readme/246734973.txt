meta-repository for Autoware architecture proposal version

This is the source code of the feasibility study for Autoware architecture proposal.
WARNING: This source is solely for demonstrating an architecture proposal. It should not be used to drive cars.
NOTE: The features in AutowareArchitectureProposal.iv will be merged into Autoware.Auto.
Architecture overview is here.
If cuda or tensorRT is already installed, it is recommended to remove it.
If cuda or tensorRT is already installed, it is recommended to remove it.
If ROS hasn't been installed yet in PC, at first run commands of 1.2 ~ 1.4, described in ROS wiki.
Set up the repository
In this step, the following software are installed.
Please confirm their licenses before using them.
Prepare launch files and vehicle_description according to the sensor configuration of your hardware.
The following are the samples.

Download sample map from here.
Download sample rosbag from here.
Launch Autoware
* Absolute path is required for map_path.

Launch Autoware
* Absolute path is required for map_path.
We are planning propose the architecture and reference implementation to AutowareAuto. For the time being, use ros_bridge if you wish to use this repository with AutowareAuto modules. You would have to do the message type conversions in order to communicate between AutowareAuto and AutowareArchitectureProposal modules until the architecture is aligned.
For setting up AutowareAuto, please follow the instruction in: 
For setting up ros_bridge, please follow the instruction in: 
See here. for more information.
